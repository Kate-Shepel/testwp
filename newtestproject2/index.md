Hello everyone! My name is Kate and this is my self-presentation!

Today I'm going to tell you a few words about myself.

 ## My education
I graduated from Belarus State Economic University and was studying there economics, management in tourism and 2 foreign languages. In march 2023 I’ve successfully finished Pre-RSSchool so called 0 stage, this is the certificate and now I am currently attending the RSSchool frontend course".

## My work experience
I’ve spent 6 eventful years in the travel industry. At first, I was working in a travel agency being responsible for 5 visa departments and after that I’ve spent a few years working as a travel specialist in an IT company developing my skills in the business trips organization process. It was an unforgettable experience! After the elections in Belarus I started working as an internal mobility specialist in Krakow helping employees to relocate to another preferable destination.

## Why Front-End?
Having worked in an IT company for almost 6 years I have become interested in the production magical process. But at first I tried testing, I even finished the EPAM testing course but after the course I realized that it is not my cup of tea, I wanted to create. 
Therefore Front-End was a perfect match for me, since there are enormous possibilities to create and also you can easily see the results of my work at once. Besides, it’s a great joy for me to do the things that you have never done before. It’s like upgrading your superpower. 
Once one wise man said:  “The path is made by walking.” Well, I keep walking step by step to make my own path to a Junior front-end development position. 

## How long have you been preparing for the 1st stage of RSSchool frontend course and where did you get your knowledge?

In total it took me 4 months. My first resources for front-end info:
* Code Basics
* Udemy
* HTML Academy
* Rolling Skopes Course «JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0» 

## What is your last project? Any difficulties with it?
I have been working on Minesweeper, it’s a game of my childhood. I was so happy to see it in the list of our closest tasks and at the same time it was hard to start believing that you will be able to do your first game. 
Moreover I decided that this project will definitely be done with webpack, despite the fact that it was not obligatory for this particular task, since it was absolutely new technology for me I have been struggling with it for 2 days and as a result I successfully enriched the new project with it. 
Also I started to create JS modules and it occurred that it’s not as easy as it seemed from the very beginning. Keep learning.

## 5 words to have high quality rest for you:
Cycling, traveling, nature, mountains, friends.
